# Voice Gender Classification using Random Forest
During an extracurricular activity, inspired by the teachings of my instructors, I developed a simple yet effective classification model. This model uses a Random Forest algorithm to classify a voice as either male or female based on various parameters derived from a Kaggle dataset.

The dataset contains various features that the Random Forest model leverages to make accurate predictions. By training the model on this data, it can distinguish between male and female voices with a high degree of accuracy.
To create and train the model, I used Google Colab, a cloud-based platform that allowed me to write and run the code easily and quickly, without the need to install anything on my computer.

Key features of this project:

Dataset: Kaggleâ€™s Voice Gender dataset, containing acoustic features such as pitch, formants, and other relevant parameters.

Model: A Random Forest classifier that processes the features and predicts the gender of the voice.

Goal: To understand and apply machine learning techniques for voice gender classification and demonstrate the power of ensemble learning methods.

The project aims to showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of Random Forests in classification tasks, providing insights into the power of ensemble learning models.
